Behaviour in order
slowest - Selection sort will go through the entire n list to find the smallest number and has no early exit when already sorted O(n^2)
fastest - Bubble sort will finish after going over the list once since it will early exit if no swaps were made
medium  - Merge sort will not early exit and consistently gover over the list O(n log n) times to sort.

2.351s - sort 3
0.559s - sort 1
0.699s - sort 2

Behaviour in reverse order
slowest - bubble sort will go over the list n^2 times until list is sorted since in worst case order
slowest - selection sort will go over the list n^2 times until list is sorted since in worst case order
fastest - will take consistently O(n log n) time

5.314s - sort 1
2.582s - sort 3
0.690s - sort 2

Behaviour in random order
fastest/slowest - bubble sort will take anywhere between Omega(n) to O(n^2)
slowest/slowest - selection sort will take consistently O(n^2)
medium/medium   - Merge sort will consistently take O(n log n) but sometimes will be beat by bubble sort since no early exit

6.470s - sort 1
0.712s - sort 2
2.942s - sort 3

sort 1 (bubble sort)
sort 2 (merge sort)
sort 3 (selection sort)
